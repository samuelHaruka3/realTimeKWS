The convolutional SNN KWS system we developed excelled in identifying specific keywords, validating its effectiveness real-time audio recognition tasks. The sturdiness of the model was corroborated under diverse noisy environments, ensuring its dependability in actual scenarios. By utilizing PyQt, the GUI delivered a seamless and instinctive user experience, allowing real-time interaction with the audio stream. The design empowers users to effortlessly initiate and deactivate audio processing, observe immediate data visualizations such as audio waveforms, Mel Spectrograms, and spike raster plots, and monitor the model's forecasts as they occur. The figures featured in this segment emphasize the GUI's design and, showcasing its ability to manage frequent updates efficiently without performance degradation.

abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to realize brain-inspired intelligence on neuromorphic chips with high energy efficiency by introducing neural dynamics and spike properties. As the emerging spiking deep learning paradigm attracts increasing interest, traditional programming frameworks cannot meet the demands of the automatic differentiation, parallel computation acceleration, and high integration of processing neuromorphic datasets and deployment. In this work, we present the SpikingJelly framework to address the aforementioned dilemma. We contribute a full-stack toolkit for preprocessing neuromorphic datasets, building deep SNNs, optimizing their parameters, and deploying SNNs on neuromorphic chips. Compared to existing methods, the training of deep SNNs can be accelerated 11×, and the superior extensibility and flexibility of SpikingJelly enable users to accelerate custom models at low costs through multilevel inheritance and semiautomatic code generation. SpikingJelly paves the way for synthesizing truly energy-efficient SNN-based machine intelligence systems, which will enrich the ecology of neuromorphic computing. Motivation and introduction of the software framework SpikingJelly for spiking deep learning.}}
